"""Agent Protocol Run Endpoints

This module provides Agent Protocol API endpoints for managing LangGraph graph executions.
It includes features for creating runs, streaming, querying status, and cancellation/interruption,
supporting real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE) and event persistence
in PostgreSQL.

Key Features:
- Run creation and asynchronous background processing.
- Real-time event delivery via SSE streaming.
- Support for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) breakpoints.
- Event storage and replay on reconnection.
- Coordination of multiple stream modes.
- Run cancellation/interruption and status management.

Endpoint List:
- POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs - Create a run (background).
- POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/stream - Create and stream a run.
- GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id} - Get a run.
- GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs - List runs.
- PATCH /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id} - Update a run's status.
- GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/join - Wait for a run to complete.
- GET /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/stream - Stream a run.
- POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id}/cancel - Cancel/interrupt a run.
- DELETE /threads/{thread_id}/runs/{run_id} - Delete a run.

Note:
- All runs are persisted to PostgreSQL (via the Run table in ORM).
- Background tasks are managed as asyncio.Tasks and tracked in the active_runs dictionary.
- Event streaming is coordinated through streaming_service and the broker.
